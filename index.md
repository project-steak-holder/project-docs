# Project Steakholder

Project Steakholder is an AI-driven stakeholder simulation tool designed to help software engineering practitioners develop and refine their requirements elicitation skills. By providing a realistic, consistent simulated stakeholder experience, the tool enables users to practice gathering requirements in a low-risk environment before engaging with real clients.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Stakeholder Simulation** - Interact with an AI-powered stakeholder persona that represents authentic business problems and responds naturally to requirements elicitation techniques
- **Contextual Consistency** - The simulated stakeholder maintains memory and context across conversations, ensuring coherent and realistic dialogue throughout a project scenario
- **Requirements Capture** - Automatically captures and persists elicited requirements as you work through the simulation
- **Configurable Project Parameters** - Customize scenarios based on team size, experience level, available skills, and project duration to match your learning objectives
- **Viable Scenario Generation** - Generates realistic project scenarios that respect your configured constraints and provide meaningful practice opportunities
